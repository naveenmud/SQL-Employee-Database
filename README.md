## Project Overview

This is a research project on employees of a corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

In this project, I designed tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and analyzed the data to gain insights about the employees.
